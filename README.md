# Next.js on Google Cloud Platform

This is a demo [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project powered by
GCP's serverless infrastructure.

Visit the [**live demo site**](https://nextjs-on-gcp.web.app/) to see it in action.

## Service Infrastructure

Dynamic content is generated by server running on [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/overview/what-is-cloud-run), a fully managed compute platform that automatically scales stateless containers.

Static assets are served by [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting), a fast and secure way to host static content globally. Firebase Hosting also simplifies the process of connecting a custom domain for applications running on Cloud Run.

Next.js cache handler is implemented with [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database), persisting cached pages and data to reduce server workloads by fulfilling requests from cached content when possible.

## Deploying on your own project

Use the [`setup.sh`](scripts/setup.sh) to provision your GCP project:

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh -p my-project -r us-central1
```

Then, build and deploy the application on [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/overview). Use the [`deploy.sh`](scripts/deploy.sh) to quickly get started:

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh -p my-project -r us-central1
```
